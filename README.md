## Welcome to Azure Mission-Critical Connected

Azure Mission-Critical is an open source project that provides a **prescriptive architectural approach to building highly-reliable cloud-native applications on Microsoft Azure for mission-critical workloads**. This repository contains the Azure Mission-Critical *connected* reference implementation a **Fully Functional Production-Ready Azure Mission-Critical Reference Implementation**:
An end-to-end reference implementation intended to provide a solution orientated basis to showcase mission-critical application development on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure-native platform capabilities to maximize reliability and operational effectiveness. More specifically, the reference implementation consists of:

- Design and implementation guidance to help readers understand and use the Azure Mission-Critical design methodology in the context of a particular industry scenario.
- Production-ready technical artifacts including Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) resources and Continuous-Integration/Continuous-Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (GitHub and Azure DevOps) to deploy an Azure Mission-Critical application with mature end-to-end operational wrappers.

This repository contains the reference implementation for an Azure Mission-Critical **enterprise connected scenario**. The pipeline deploys the application Azure Subscription security and compliance guardrails and takes a dependency on pre-provided Virtual Networks for connectivity to other company resources (usually achieved through a hub-and-spoke model via peering).
